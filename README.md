# Babybear Model

This is the code for [the paper](https://www.overleaf.com/project/619841524ce34d2c4ace0c2a) "An inference triage model on classification and ner problems".

The code is written in python and requires ....

## Get Started

You can generate the results of the paper with the noteboos in Tutorials. 

`Load_data.ipynb` creates the input data for the three dataset investigated in this paper. The results of each dataset can be generated using the notebooks `Tutorial/ncbi_disease.ipynb`

## Source Code

The source code is available at `src/` and is separated into following parts:
* `nlx_babybear.py`: Defines the babybear model
* `inference_triage.py`: Defines the papabear model and the inference triage scheme
* `util_funcs.py`: It contains functions to apply the data preprocessing.
